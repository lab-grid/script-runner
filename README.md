# script-runner

Enables the deployment of a script as an API protected by pluggable authentication
(only `auth0` or `none` currently supported). Script runner relies on a configuration
file (`config.json`) to specify the command that should be executed when a task is
started. Script runner exposes an API with two main endpoints:

- `POST /task` - Start new task
- `GET  /task/{id}` - Check task status/get results

Arguments to the script command can be passed via the request path, query, or JSON
body.

Script runner relies on two running containers (see Usage section below on how to deploy these):

- Server - Responsible for responding to API requests and validating auth headers.
- Worker - Responsible for running the script whenever a new task is started.

Script runner can handle scripts that take a long period of time to run. The worker nodes launch jobs. 
Communication between the server and worker nodes happens through a Redis instance, allowing multiple script 
invocations to be running simultaneously


## Configuration

Script runner can be configured through a special file called `config.json`:

```
{
    "command": [ ... ],
    "inputs": {
        "path_args": [ ... ],
        "query_args": [ ... ],
        "body_args": [ ... ]
    },
    "outputs": {
        "results": {
            "kind": "file",
            "format": "csv",
            "input_path": ...,
            "remapped_columns": [ ... ]
        },
        "attachments": [ ... ]
    }
}
```

### Command

The command used to launch run the desired script is specified through the `"command": [ ... ]`
field. Specify each argument as a separate string. Parameters from the request path, query, or
body can be used in the command by prefixing the parameter name with a `$` sign:

```
    "command": [ "/scripts/my_script.sh", "regular-arg-1", "$THIS_ARGUMENT_COMES_FROM_REQUEST" ]
```

### Inputs

Parameters used in the script command are specified in the `"inputs": { ... }` field. The name of the
variable for use in the command definition above is set by the `"env_var_name": "..."` field. First,
select whether or not you would like to have the parameter specified in the request path, query, or body.

Path parameters are defined using [regular expressions](https://www.scaler.com/topics/python/regular-expression-in-python/)  (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp)

```
...

"path_args": [
    {
        "env_var_name": "BASESPACE_ID",
        "path_regex": "([^/]+)",
        "path_regex_match_group": 1
    }
],

...
```

Query parameters are defined by specifying the query parameter name:

```
...

"query_args": [
    {
        "env_var_name": "SEASON",
        "query_var_name": "season"
    }
],

...
```

Body parameters are defined by specifying a JSONPath query (https://jsonpath.com/):

```
...

"body_args": [
    {
        "env_var_name": "CITY",
        "body_jsonpath": "$.address.city"
    }
],

...
```

### Outputs

The JSON data returned by the script-runner API can be configured in the `"outputs"` section.

Script-runner reads a main file that can be either in a JSON or CSV file format to parse and
send back as JSON under the `"results"` field. Script-runner also supports an `"attachments"`
field that base64-encodes requested files into the JSON object response.

For example, the following config:

```
"outputs": {
    "results": {
        "kind": "file",
        "format": "csv",
        "input_path": "LIMS_results.csv",
        "remapped_columns": [
            {
                "output_name": "plateIndex",
                "input_name": "Plate_384_Number",
                "skip_list": ["NA"]
            }
        ]
    },
    "attachments": [
        "*.pdf",
        "LIMS_results.csv"
    ]
}
```

Could produce the following output:

```
{
    "id": "168af779-a72e-4dec-a2e3-36240cad5973",
    "status": "ready",
    "attachments": {
        "results-n1a54tmd.pdf": "JVBERi0xLjUKJdDUxdgKNiAwI...",
        ...
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "plateIndex": "1",
            "plateCell": "A01",
            "marker1": "CATCTGTATC",
            "marker2": "ATGAGACTTG",
            "classification": "failed: low S2 & RPP30"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```


## Usage

To get a script-runner API setup and running:

1. Build a docker container with your script and script-runner installed.

   ```
   FROM python
   
   pip install script-runner-api
   
   # Install your script here
   COPY ./my_script.sh /app/my_script.sh
   
   # ...
   ```
   
2. Setup your `config.json` file. See `Configuration` section for more information.
3. Deploy a worker and a server to your desired environment. We have provided some started
   [terraform](https://terraform.io/) modules
   ([AWS](https://github.com/lab-grid/terraform-aws-ecs-script-runner),
   [Azure](https://github.com/lab-grid/terraform-azurerm-container-instances-script-runner))
   + [examples](https://github.com/lab-grid/script-runner/tree/main/terraform) to help get started.
